Peer's repository:  https://github.com/ToxiicMarker/03-Text-adeventure-2.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

 By looking at his json.file, I thought the idea that using the field IKEA was really interesting.
 However, somehow the project did not run correctly, so I could not see what is going to be on in the game.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
Like I said, the context of the project was really interesting. Using baby at IKEA sounds really crazy, but attractive
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
At least I wanted to see what is going to happen at the project.  Getting error all the time is pretty sad so
He better looked back what was on his project.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
I cannot comment on details actually because the coding is not running correctly.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
He used invenory to his project, and I did not.  That's why inventory coding seemed pretty much confusing.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
 Yes it did contain appropriatly.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
He did not edit any of README, so if I could see his thought about this project, that would be nice.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
He couldn't run the project, but that means he tried much harder and complicated things.  I think that is amazing thing, and I hope he keeps trying as this project.
